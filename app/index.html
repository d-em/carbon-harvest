        <p class="intro intro__hero">The BiotronTower™ from Carbon Harvest is a unique, bolt-on, addition to your flue-gas emission source that literally turns your waste emissions into environmentally friendly, saleable biomass.</p>

      <h2>Just add CO&#8322;</h2>
      <p class="intro intro__overview">Bolted onto your existing flue system, the BiotronTower™ captures and uses carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions to produce valuable algal biomass.</p>
      <h3>Minimal impact &ndash; maximum benefits</h3>
      <p>Land and water requirements are minimal meaning that the BiotronTower™ can be situated close to the emission source as a scalable, standalone bio-refinery that operates reliably 24 hours a day, 7 days a week all year round.</p>
      <p>Current estimates indicate that two tonnes of CO&#8322; flue emissions will produce one tonne of saleable dry biomass. Production at this rate will lock up <strong>0.5 tonnes of carbon</strong> whilst releasing <strong>1 tonne of oxygen</strong> into the atmosphere – greatly enhancing your corporate social responsibility.</p>
      <p>That&rsquo;s a lot of algae right? Algae is pretty useful stuff though – see how it&rsquo;s used&hellip;</p>

      <h2>Output</h2>
      <p class="intro intro__benefits">Microalgae biomass is rich in protein (up to 70%), antioxidants, carbohydrates (5&mdash;15%) and fatty acids (10&mdash;20%). Algal biomass also provides Omega-3 (EPA+DHA) required by farmed fish.</p>
      <p>That means that dry algae biomass meal can be used as a protein supplement for use in animal and fish feeds. Algae biomass can also be used for human food – ever heard of spirulina? The spirulina in your morning smoothie contains 3 x the amount of usable protein as beef! Plant based meat is big business but algae biomass is also a large part of the cosmetics industry and is also utilised in the manufacture of bio-degradable plastics and even bio-jet fuel.</p>

      <h2>Who are we?</h2>
      <p>Fair question. Carbon Harvest Ltd was set up to monetise nearly 20 years of research and development into driving photosynthesis in algae enclosed in a three-dimensional container.</p>  
      <p>So - we&rsaquo;ve been at this for a long time&hellip;</p>
      <p>The BiotronTower™ Technology is the culmination of this research and is configured as a high technology, precision controlled, ultra-high productivity system designed by applying advanced science, engineering, processing and marketing principles designed to provide industrial scale biomass production at commercially acceptable Return-on-Investment.</p>
      <p>The focus of Carbon Harvest Ltd is to continue with its R&amp;D program for the development of algal biomass based high value products, the continued development BiotronTower™ systems, and algae species culture maintenance, in support of the provision of consultancy technology services to industrial users.</p>
